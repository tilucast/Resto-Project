# About this project

This is a simple Angular project, performing CRUD operations. Got the idea from a tutorial made by this youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvHX2bCZG2m9ddUhwxudKYA.

I followed his videos, but the code itself is mine. 

We are using <a href="https://github.com/typicode/json-server">json-server</a> as a database.
I'm also using <a href="https://github.com/ngneat/svg-icon">svg-icon</a> to handle svgs.


Also, i'd like to make clear, the styling and css in general is poorly written, since that was not the focus of this project.
But it is kinda responsive. I'm also using Material UI to handle some stuff, like modals, form styling, etc.


# Running json-server

In the root folder, type on your terminal ```` json-server --watch db.json ```` to start the server. Please, refer to the documentation for more details
on how to perform crud operations.
